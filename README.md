# resource-scheduler
project:
  name: "ðŸ“Š Resource Scheduler (Bank Teller/Call Center)"
  course: "CSC 2101 - Operating Systems | Task 2"
  description: |
    This project is a **Resource Scheduler** that dynamically assigns **bank tellers/call center agents** 
    to customer requests based on different scheduling algorithms.
    The goal is to **minimize wait time**, **maximize resource utilization**, and **ensure fairness**.

features:
  - "âœ… Simulates customer arrivals with **random priority & service time**"
  - "âœ… Assigns agents dynamically based on **Round Robin, Priority, or Shortest Job Next** scheduling"
  - "âœ… **Real-time monitoring** of agent workload & customer queue"
  - "âœ… **Web-based dashboard (React.js)** for visualizing agent status"
  - "âœ… **Containerized with Docker & deployed via GitHub Actions**"
  - "âœ… **Automated deployment using Render**"

tech_stack:
  backend:
    - "Python (Flask)"
    - "Flask-SocketIO"
  frontend:
    - "React.js"
  database:
    - "PostgreSQL (or SQLite for testing)"
  deployment:
    - "Docker"
    - "GitHub Actions"
    - "Render (instead of AWS/Heroku)"
